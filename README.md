# Bus Tracker
 Maps API 
 
In this project, I used the MapBox API to display a real time navigation map on the document object module. With the use of JavaScript we were able to use markers which display a certain point on the map in latitude and longitude. 

How to Run:

The map features use these markers to display bus stop between MIT and Harvard. When the button is clicked, an array or latitude and longitude points are passed through a function to show the different stops.
