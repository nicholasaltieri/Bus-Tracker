# Bus Tracker
 Maps API 
 
In this project, I used the MapBox API to display a real time navigation map on the document object module. With the use of JavaScript we were able to use markers which display a certain point on the map in latitude and longitude. 

How to Run:

The map features use these markers to display bus stop between MIT and Harvard. When the button is clicked, an array or latitude and longitude points are passed through a function to show the different stops.

Going forward, I plan to implement a function that will set markers on the map between mus stops with an icon of the bus. Additionally, there are navigation features on the MapBox API that I would also like to include in this project. Other mapbox features could be implemented as well.
