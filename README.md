# Bus Tracker
 Maps API 
 
In this project, I used the MapBox API to display a real time navigation map on the document object module. With the use of JavaScript we were able to use markers which display a certain point on the map in latitude and longitude. 

The map features use these markers to display bus stop between MIT and Harvard. When the button is clicked, an array or latitude and longitude points are passed through a function to show the different stops.
